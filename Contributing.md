Please feel free to submit patches to Migrator.NET, no need to ask! Just document the issue/feature well on the issues page, and attach your patch.

# Submitting Patches #

Patches should be added via the issues page on the Google Code project.

http://code.google.com/p/migratordotnet/issues/list

Please attach any patch files with a summary & bug description.

## Patch Standards ##

Please create one patch per functional change (including tests). Large patches containing non-related functionality will probably be told to repatch as separate issues.

  * All patches should be complete and include unit tests for any changes that are being made
  * If the tests don't pass, the patch won't be applied
  * Use good coding practices (Avoid code duplication, Refactor to add new code when necessary)
